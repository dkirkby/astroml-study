    "What's the idea?  A set of data is a sample drawn from some distribution.  As such, each datum has a probabilty; if we make the assumption that these probabilities are independent, we arrive fairly intuitively at the measure of likelihood for the sample:\n",

    "<h3>4.2.7 MLE in the Case of Truncated and Censored Data</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable to be measured, x, has some range of possible values; due to e.g. the measuring aparatus used, the range of values is not sampled uniformly.  So: $S(x) \\neq c$, where $S$ is the PDF for sampling x.  In particular, for some values of $x$, $S(x)=0$.  When this last is true for some $x<x_{min}$ and/or $x > x_{max}$, the data set is said to be truncated.  (Censored data is where data has been removed for some reason.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take the Gaussian case, and the simple truncation $$S(x) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}c & x_{min} \\leq x \\leq x_{max} \\\\ 0 & otherwise \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. $$ with $c$ a constant to make $S(x)$ sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability distribution for $x$ needs to be renormalized to account for this truncation:  $p(x)$ needs to be scaled to become $C~p(x)$ such that $1 = {\\displaystyle \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}} C~p(x)$  For this example case this is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C = C(\\mu, \\sigma, x_{min}, x_{max}) = \\frac{1}{P(x_{max}|\\mu, \\sigma) - P(x_{min}|\\mu, \\sigma)} \\tag{4.12}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "<h3>4.2.8 Beyond the Likelihood:  Other Cost Functions and Robustness</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "MLE represents the most common choice of cost functions.  The expectation value of the cost function is called \"risk.\"  Minimizing risk is a way to obtain best-fit parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean integrated square error (MISE),\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MISE = \\displaystyle \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} [f(x) - h(x)]^2 d~x \\tag{4.14}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is often used.  MISE is based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), aka the $L_2$ norm.  A cost function minimizing the absoluate deviation is called the $L_1$ norm.  Many cost functions, with different properties; a particularly useful example of a property is robustness to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapters 6-10 cost functions will be important for various methods; this is particularly true when formalizing the likelihood function is difficult, because an optimal solultion can still eb found by minimizing the risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>4.3 The Goodness of Fit and Model Selection</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "MLE estimates the best-fit parameters and gives us their uncertainties, but does not tell us how good a fit the model/parameters are.  What if a Gaussian model was choosen by e.g. the truth was Laplacian?  And what if a polynomial is being fit:  a higher order polynomial will always fit data better than a lower order polynomial, but is the higher order polynomial a better fit to the underlying process (e.g., are we just fitting noise or actually fitting additional complexity in the underlying distribution/process?)\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>4.3.1 The Goodness of Fit for a Model</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Gaussian case, we have (4.4):\n",

    "$$ln(L(\\mu))=constant-{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{N}} \\frac{(x_i - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\tag{4.4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which may be re-written with $z_i=(x_i - \\mu)/\\sigma$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ln(L(\\mu))=constant-{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{N}} z_i^2 = constant - \\frac{1}{2}\\chi^2 \\tag{4.15}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and hence the distibution of $ln(L)$ can be determined from the $\\chi^2$ distribution with $N-k$ degrees of freedom, with $k$ model parameters.  With an expectation value of $N-k$, for a \"good fit\" we should have $\\chi_{dof}^2=\\frac{\\chi^2}{N-k} \\approx 1$  (As in chapter 3, the warning here is that $\\chi$ is very sensitive to outliers.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that a certain ML value $L_{mle}$ arose by chance can only be evaluated by $\\chi^2$ when the likelihood is Gaussian; otherwise $L_{mle}$ is still a measure of how well a model fits the data.  Asssuming the same $k$, models can be ranked by their likelihood.  But the $L_{mle}$ value(s) alone do not indicated in an <i>absolute</i> sense how well the model(s) fit the data; to know that requires knowing the distribution of $L_{mle}$, as given by $\\chi^2$ for a Gaussian likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>4.3.2 Model Comparison</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to compare models is cross-validation, but this topic is covered in detail in later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Aikake Information Criterion (AIC) is a simple method for comparing models that (attempts to) accounts for model complexity in addition to $L_{mle}$ when comparing models.  AIC is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$AIC \\equiv -2~ln(L_{mle}) + 2k + \\frac{2k(k+1)}{N-k-1} \\tag{4.17}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$AIC = \\frac{2~k~N}{N-(k+1)} - 2~ln(L_{mle})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of multiple possible models, the one with the smallest AIC is the best."
